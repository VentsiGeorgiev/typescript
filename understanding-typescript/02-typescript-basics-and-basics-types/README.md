# TypeScript and Basics Types

### Notes:

-   The key difference is:
    JavaScript uses 'dynamic types' (resolved at runtime),
    TypeScript uses 'static types' (set during development).

#### Core Types:

-   number - 1, 5.4, -10 - All numbers, no difference between integers or floats
-   string - 'Hi' - All text values
-   boolean - true/false
-   object - {age: 30} - Any JS objects
-   Array - [1,2,3] - Any JS array
-   Tuple - [1,2] - Added by TypeScript: Fixed length array
-   Enum - enum {NEW, OLD} - Added by TypeScript: Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers
-   any - \* - any kind of value, no specific type assignment
